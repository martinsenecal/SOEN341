## Project Description
Creating an Instagram-like application for photo sharing.

## Objective
The objective of the project is to create an interactive, photo-sharing platform. This platform will allow users to post pictures to a profile, follow other users and post comments on photos.

User will then be able to comment to and like photos directly from this feed.
